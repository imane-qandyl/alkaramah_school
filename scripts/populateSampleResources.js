## What is a friend?
A friend is someone who:
- Likes to spend time with you
- Is kind and caring
- Shares toys and activities
- Listens when you talk

## How to make friends:
1. **Say hello** - Look at the person and smile
2. **Ask to join** - "Can I play with you?"
3. **Share** - Offer to share your toys or snacks
4. **Be kind** - Use nice words and gentle touches
5. **Take turns** - Let others have a turn too

## What to do if someone says no:
- That's okay! Not everyone wants to play right now
- Try asking someone else
- Find another activity to do
- Remember: You are still a good person

## Practice phrases:
- "Hi, my name is..."
- "What are you playing?"
- "That looks fun!"
- "Would you like to play together?"

Remember: Making friends takes practice. Be patient with yourself!`,
